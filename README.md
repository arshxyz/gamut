## TODO
- [x] Remove unused OAuth scopes
- [x] Use prettier spinners and prompts
- [ ] Show color info for each track during processing/adding
- [ ] Finetune colour matching
- [ ] Write a proper README

## Maybe
- [ ] Add alternative names for playlists without emojis for Windows
- [ ] Error handling can be better
- [ ] Add paging for AddTrackToPlaylist (handles edge case where 100+ tracks have been liked from the same album)
